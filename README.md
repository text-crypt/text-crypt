    The @text-crypt is a drab quiet place on the internet where i stow my scripts.

    I often cask my works for long periods of time during or after development.
    Due to this disposition i ensure all of my publications share two attributes.
        Works are thoroughly commented to ensure recollection of my own processes.
        Scripts require very few dependencies to ensure longevity.

    The repositories found here have been published primarily for my own usage.
    Despite my selfish motivation usage of these scripts by others is encouraged.

    These files may prove useful for education for the following reasons.
        Extreme commenting and formatting provide clear context for each process.
        Thorough error handling makes scripts conducive to editing and importation.

    All scripts published here are for private or corporate uses free of charge.
    All scripts posted here are free to be edited or otherwise adulterated.
        If any of my work is copied please include information found in the header.
